# Categories and Birational Geometry 2020

This repo contains my talk at the Categories and Birational Geometry Conference, held virtually in December 2020. The presentation may be found in `202012catbir.html` and the rest of the repo is the accompanying revealjs stuff.

### Abstract
A famous theorem of Gabriel states that two varieties are isomorphic if and only if their categories of coherent sheaves are equivalent. On the other hand, two varieties are birational if and only if their function fields are isomorphic. In this talk I will discuss an elementary result which interpolates between these two theorems. Namely, taking the quotient of Coh(X) by sheaves supported in codimension c (or bigger) controls the isomorphism type of X in codimension c. This is joint work with Roberto Pirisi.
